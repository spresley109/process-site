					<p>For my secondary research process, I tried to find organizations who had similar goals as the Augusta Care Pregnancy Center. I found some sites online that had similar issues with their online presceince. But I found one site in particular that I drew inspiration from. It is called The Source. A Texas based organization that has pooled together the resources of several CPCs. Their website has a beautiful flow and hiearchy to it. It is easy to navigate and their mission is clear as well. I found it helpful to find an organization that had the same goals as Augusta CPC and were doing an excellent job with their online presence. 
						
					<p>
						In my research, I also repeatedly came across articles talking about how CPCs had a hidden agenda behind helping these mothers in need. I believe part of the solution should definitely include clarity on the purpose and goal of the organization to clear the air and negate some of the fear-mongering around pro-life organzations. I don't know if this is necessarily something I can accomplish through design, but I feel it is important to clearly state the intentions and goals. Some women were expressing frustation that they felt they could not get the help they needed without being pressured into religion. Maybe there is a more tasteful way to go about it?

			<p>
				In this article, I read about what lead women to seek out a CPC and what turned them away. Also, I was presented with statistics about how many women actually found the CPCs methods to be attractive and sought out follow-ups. 

				In this research article, 13.1% of respondants confirmed a vist with a CPC organization. It was confirmed that the chances of a visit were much lower with the CPC location being futher away. The odds of women reconsidering abortion were significantly increased after an appointment at a CPC. 

				All in all, it is concluded that these women are seeking access to accurate information, decision support, and resources to make the pregnancy decision that is best for them.
