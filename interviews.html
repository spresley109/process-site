					<h2>Jill</h2>
					<p><strong>1. Can you tell me about what Augusta CPC does? </strong></p>
					<p>Augusta CPC mainly helps women in crisis pregnancies. This organization educates woman about what an abortion is, how it hurts everyone involved, and offers help to women who choose life for their baby.  Augusta CPC offers physical needs for baby(diapers, baby food, car seats, toys, clothes) physical needs for mom (shelter, clothes, money for bills) emotional needs (parenting classes, relationship classes, bible studies, post-abortion counseling). We offer free pregnancy tests, counseling and sonograms.</p>
					<p><strong>2. What is your role in the organization?</strong></p>
					<p> I am a counselor at CPC. I volunteer once a week at the center that is a stones throw from the abortion clinic. Women come in to receive receive a free pregnancy test. Sometimes they are happy with a positive result and just need Medicare help and encouragement. Sometimes they need help getting away from an abusive boyfriend. Sometimes they just need to hear the gospel and truth that God loves them and their baby and who has a great plan for both of them.</p>
					<p><strong>3. What inspired you to work in a non-profit like the CPC?</strong></p>
					<p>My relationship with the Lord inspired me to work for a nonprofit organization. He tells us to serve others and I felt like volunteering to help people in need is honoring the command God gives us to love and serve others.</p>
					<p><strong>4. Have you had any experience with a non-profit before working for Augusta CPC?</strong></p>
					<p>I have volunteered at a crisis pregnancy center in Greenville and Charleston as a counselor.</p>
					<p><strong>5. What impacts you the most about your organization?</strong></p>
					<p>Saving a baby's life means the most to me in this organization. It’s wonderful to help a girl in need when they are pro-life and amazing to help bring girls to the Lord
					by sharing the gospel. It’s also humbling and wonderful to help a girl realize she doesn’t have to stay with a man who treats her terribly. But there is nothing more powerful to me then helping a woman to see the precious blessing and miracle of choosing life for her child.</p>
					<p><strong>6. Can you tell me a little bit about the other staff?</strong></p>
					<p>Everyone I have met who volunteers at CPC Augusta have a true passion to save babies and help women in bad situations. They all understand that sharing the gospel is very important in the process of saving babies. Many of the women who volunteer have an abortion story of their own in their past and feel led to share their stories to women to help them understand that abortion does not end a “problem”, it starts a whole new set of life long problems. Many of the volunteers have gone through the post abortion counseling and that led to them wanting to volunteer to help others.</p>
					<p><strong>7. Do you know what the ultimate goal of the website is? (gain volunteers, donations, users?)</strong></p>
					<p> The ultimate goal of the website is to get the word out to hurting women who need help with an unplanned pregnancy. The website also lets people know about the different services it offers like free pregnancy tests, free sonograms, classes, and baby items. It is also used to let people know how they can help by donating and volunteering.</p>

					<p>This interview with Jill helped me better understand the purpose and motivations behind the volunteers and staff of Augusta CPC. It also provided me with a more in depth understanding of the services they offer.  </p>

					<h2>Jennifer</h2>

					<p><strong>1. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?</strong></p>
					<p>My name is Jennifer Downey. I am a stay at home mother.</p>
					<p><strong>2. Have you ever donated to the Augusta CPC? If so, why?</strong></p>
					<p>Our church has made donations in the past, which we contributed to and we have made a donation at the Fall Banquet before. We did this because we believe in the cause of CPC and want to help prevent women who are considering abortion to have a choice.</p>
					<p><strong>3. Have you ever volunteered/assisted with a non-profit organization?</strong></p>
					<p>Yes, I have volunteered with Guardian Ad Litem in the past.</p>

					<p><strong>4. What drove you to volunteer for that/those particular organization(s)?</strong></p>
					<p>I was interested in working with abused children. </p>
					<p><strong>5. How did volunteering affect you personally?</strong></p>
					<p>It increased my burden for children who were suffering abuse and made me want to seek out other non-profits.</p>
					<p><strong>6. When you visited the Augusta CPC website, what were your initial thoughts/experience?</strong></p>
					<p>I thought it had good info and helpful resources available. I was surprised that the Fall 2021 Banquet info was taking up almost the entire home page since it has already occurred so it might need updating. It was pretty easy to navigate but it had some glitches that involved portions of the screen being blacked out and some sizing disparity which caused portions of the text to not fit on my phone screen. I do believe that someone who needed support could access the info they needed (although it may be a little challenging). </p>
					<p><strong>7. Was the information easy to access? Were you able to understand the mission of the organization from the website?</strong></p>
					<p>I think my above comments probably apply to ease of access. I do think determining the mission might be a little difficult for some folks who may have additional challenges/struggles such as, being under a lot of stress, being under influence of drugs or not having English as their first language.</p>
						
					<p>For the average person it should be clear but I have heard that there is a general problem that sometimes occurs in ministries like CPC where people confuse the purpose of the organization. </p>

					<p><strong>8. Any thoughts on the overall color choices and branding?</strong></p>
					<p>I think the colors could be updated and more appealing. Also, the logo was confusing to me.</p>
					<p><strong>9. Any additional thoughts?</strong></p>
					<p>I believe that adding something on the homepage that makes clear the mission and provides comfort and hope to someone visiting the website is really necessary. </p>

					<p>This interview with Jennifer helped to understand what a user is looking for/the thought process and motivation of the user. It also helped me to view the site from the perspective of a user and hone in on what may be important hierarchically.</p>
