				<p><span class="image right"><img src="./assets/AUGUSTA-CPC/home-page.png" alt="home-page" /></span>
				<P>During my research, I did not find a lot of information about the Augusta Care Preganacy Center
					outside of their website. I provided several photographs of the website, as well as, a few images of
					resources I found beyond their site. </P>

				<p>The home page is quite cluttered and overwhelming to look at and navigate through. I do not feel like
					the purpose of their organization is conveyed clearly - you definitely have to do a little digging
					to figure it out. The home page mainly consists of an outdated flyer from an event (in repetiton
					down the page) with a lot of text.</p>

				<p>I navigated to the donation page, and yet again, I feel like you have to have prior knowledge of the
					organization to understand and the donations page does not provide any more clarity. The donations
					page gives several options and a lot of information to fill out that may try the users patience.</p>

				<p>There is a page for classes offered. I feel like this is more directed at the intended client. The
					CPC offers a Post Abortion support group. Parenting classes for pregnant/new mothers (as well as the
					fathers). Healthy relationship classes (an 8 week course). As well as, a Bible study offered every
					Thursday. Attendance in any of these classes gives mothers points that can be used at the Mommy
					Store. </p>

				<p> I think that the information provided on the site is very important
					and much of it is necessary but it is
					displayed in an unnnecessarily complicated way. I found some information outside of their site that
					is a little more direct, including a Q and A about their services, etc. I found some information
					about the CPC on an affiliated church blog as well.</p>
